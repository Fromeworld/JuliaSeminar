# JuliaSeminar

<<<<<<< HEAD
What we need:
* The latest, stable, [Julia release](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
* Fire up Julia before the presentation and install these packages, by typing `]` followed by `add Measurements, Plots, Pluto` and pressing `Enter`.

That's it, we are good to go.

Presentations:

* Scientific coding in Julia

* Introduction
  - Variables
  - Functions
=======
The goal of this seminar is to give a complete overview to aspects of the Julia language as well as general design patterns and practices which are relevant for scientific programming. That is, ultimately, how to write performant albeit general and transparent code in Julia.
