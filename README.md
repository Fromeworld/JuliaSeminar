# JuliaSeminar

The goal of this seminar is to give a complete overview to specifics of the Julia language as well as general design patterns and pratises which are relevant for scientific programming. That is, ultimately, how to write performant albeit general and transparent code in Julia.

The contents of this seminar were greatly inspired by the incredible workshops by
  - [Carsten Bauer](https://github.com/crstnbr)
  - [George Datseris](https://github.com/Datseris)
and also by the offical Julia documention and various Discourse, Reddit and stackoverflow discussions.
