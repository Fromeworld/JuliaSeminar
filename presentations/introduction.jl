## Variables

A variable, in Julia, is a name associated (or bound) to a value

##### The assignment operator is `=`

- Lax name binding: assign pretty much _anything_ to a name (functions are [first class]( https://rosettacode.org/wiki/First-class_functions#Julia))
- Variable names can include [Unicode characters](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/unicode-input/).
- **All Julia operations return a value**. This includes assignment.


```julia
x = 1

# \alpha + TAB
Œ± = 3

# \:smile_cat: + TAB
üò∏ = 2

üò∏ + Œ± # You can `TAB` before completing the command: try \alp + TAB
```

Silence printing in the REPL or notebooks by adding `;`
```julia
ƒß = 6_626_070_15/1_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000;
```

And literal numbers can multiply anything without having to put `*` inbetween, as long as the number is on the left side:
```julia
5x - 1.2e-5x
```

In Julia, apart from very few speficic keywords being locked, you can pretty much redefine* predefined functions and constants, _as long as you didn't use them before_.
```julia
œÄ = 3 # Archimedes of Syracuse is now crying

(+)(a,b) = "I refuse to add numbers"
3 + 2
```
A good way to think of this is that one is __shadowing__ the the `(+)` methods that ship with Julia's `Base` library. You can still access them by doing `Base.(+)(3,2)`.
The best, _really_, is not to redefine such holy operators as `(+)`.


##### Everything that exists in Julia has a certain **Type**.
Always be aware which are the underlying types of the variables.

To find the type of a thing in Julia, use `typeof(thing)`:

```julia
typeof(üò∏) # returns Int

typeof("thursday seminar") # returns String
```

## Basic collections

Indexing a collection is done with brackets: `collection[index]`. The `index` is typically an integer, but the indexing type can be (re)defined for any collection.

**JULIA INDEXING STARTS FROM 1**

### Arrays

A Julia `Array` is a **mutable** and **ordered** collection of items of the same type.

The dimensionality of the Julia array is important. 
- A `Vector` is an `Array` of dimension 1
- A `Matrix` is an `Array` of dimension 2. 
The *element type* or *length* of an array is independent of its dimension.

Syntax: `[item1, item2, ...]`

```julia
myfriends = ["Karl", "Friedrich", "Vladimir", "Theodor", "Slavoj"]
years = [1818, 1820, 1870, 1903, 1949]
mixture = [1818, 1820, 1870, "Theodor", "Slavoj"]
```

The `mixture` array indeed has elements of the same type: the type `Any`: _the union of all types_. This is akin to a Python list and can't be optimised since the array can hold elements of _any_ type (hence it's internally an array of pointers).

**Vector of Vectors of Numbers and a Matrix of Numbers are two totally different things!**

```julia
vec_of_vec = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]

# To create a matrix

# (1) specify each entry one by one
matrix = [1 2 3; # elements in same row separated by space
          4 5 6; # semicolon means "go to next row"
          7 8 9]

# (2) create a 1D array and reshape it: Julia arrays are column major!
v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
matrix = reshape(v, 3, 3)
```

The `:` symbol can be used to select all elements in some dimension.
```julia
matrix[:,1]
```

Since **arrays are mutable** their entries and size can be changed
```julia
fibonacci = [1, 1, 2, 3, 6]
fibonacci[5] = 5

push!(fibonacci, 8)
fibonacci
```

### Ranges
A range is a sequence of of numbers, most commonly used for looping or creating equally spaced grids (the latter aka `linspace`). The syntax is

```
start:step:end
range(start, end; length = ...)
range(start, end; step = ...)
```

```julia
r = 0:0.01:5
```

A range is not unique to numeric data
```julia
rs = 'a':'z'
collect(rs)
```

Ranges **do not store all elements in memory** like `Array`s (unless `collect`ed). Their elements are generated on the fly.

Ranges are also used to index into arrays:
```julia
A = rand(10)
A[1:3] # gets the first 3 elements of `A`
A[end-2:end] # gets the last three elements of `A`
```

If `A` is multidimensional:
```julia
A = rand(4, 4)
A[1:3, 1]
```

### Tuples
Tuples are ordered immutable collections of elements. Use them to group together related data not necessarily of of the same type.

Syntax: `(item1, item2, ...)`


```julia
myfavoritethings = ("mensa", "cats", œÄ)
myfavoritethings[1] # returns "mensa"
```


### NamedTuples

These are exactly like tuples but also assign a name to each field they contain.

Syntax: `(key1 = val1, key2 = val2, ...)`


```julia
myfavoritethings = (place="mensa", pets="cats", number=œÄ)
```

These objects can be accessed with `[1]` like normal tuples, with they key symbol `[:key]` and also with `.key`.

```julia
nt[1]
nt.place
nt[:place] # returns "mensa"
```

**Pro-tip**: You can use @unpack from `UnPack.jl` with named tuples!

## Control-flow and iteration
Iteration in Julia is high-level. This means that not only it has an intuitive and simple syntax, but also iteration works with anything that can be iterated. Iteration can also be extended (more on that later).


### `for` loops

A `for` loop iterates over a container and executes a piece of code, until the iteration has gone through all the elements of the container. The syntax for a `for` loop is

```julia
for *var* in *loop iterable*
    *loop body*
end
```

Example:
```julia
for n ‚àà 1:5 # \in
    println(n)
end
```

### `while` loops

A `while` loop executes a code block until a boolean condition check (that happens at the start of the block) becomes `false`. Then the loop terminates (without executing the block again). The syntax for a standard `while` loop is

```julia
while *condition*
    *loop body*
end
```

Example:
```julia
n = 0
while n < 5
    n += 1
    println(n)
end
```
"""

### List comprehension

Comprehensions provide a general and powerful way to construct arrays. Comprehension syntax is similar to set construction notation in mathematics:

$A = [ F(x,y,...) \text{for}\, x=rx, y=ry, ... ]$

F(x,y,...) is evaluated with the variables x, y, etc. taking on each value in their given list of values. The result is an `N`-d dense array with dimensions that are the concatenation of the dimensions of the variable ranges `rx`, `ry`, etc.

```julia
a = [sin(x) for x in range(0.0, œÄ, length=1000)]
a = [sin(x) for x in range(-œÄ, +œÄ, length=1000) if x > 0]
```

### Generator Expressions

Comprehensions can also be written without the enclosing square brackets, producing a generator. **This object can be iterated** to produce values on demand, instead of allocating an array and storing them in advance

```julia
a = (evaluate_expensive_function(x) for x in range(-œÄ, œÄ, length=1000))
```

### Conditionals

Conditionals execute a specific code block depending on what is the outcome of a given boolean check. 
#### with `if`

In Julia, the syntax

```julia
if *condition 1*
    *option 1*
elseif *condition 2*
    *option 2*
else
    *option 3*

## Functions

A function is an object that maps a tuple of argument values to a return value.
Julia functions are not pure mathematical functions, because they can alter and be affected by the global state of the program.

The [basic syntax](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/) is

```julia
function f(x, y)
    return x + y
end
```

or, as a 1-liner
```julia
f(x,y) = x + y

f(3,4) # returns 7
```

Since a function name is just a `keyword`
```julia
g(x,y) = f(x,y)

# or, alternatively
h = f

# evals to `true`
f(3,4) == g(3,4) == h(3,4) 
```

The `+` symbol is actually a function name as well so even though it's terribly useful to use it between operands, it is actually just another function, expecting arguments delimited by parenthesis

Operators such as `+` are called _infix_ operators.

- Question: Can you name other _infix_ operators?

```julia
+(2,3) # returns 5
```

Functions in Julia support
- optional positional arguments: **always given by their order**
- keyword arguments: **always given by their keyword** (arguments defined iafter the symbol `;`)

```julia
g(x, y = 5; z = 2) = x * z * y

g(5) # give x. default y, z
g(5, 3) # give x, y. default z
g(5; z = 3) # give x, z. default y
g(2, 4; z = 1.5) # give everything
g(2, 4, 2) # keyword arguments can't be specified by position
```

#### Exercise: Collatz conjecture

Given a positive integer, create a function `collatz` that counts the steps it takes to reach `1` following the [Collatz conjecture algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) (if $n$ is odd do $n=3n+1$ otherwise do $n=n/2$).

```julia
collatz(100) == 25
```

Challenge: can you do it without loops?

**Pro-tip**: make a type-stable function by using `√∑`, (`\div<TAB>`): In Julia `/` is the floating point devision operator and thus `n/m` is always a float number even if `n, m` are integers.

### Anonymous functions

Functions can also be created anonymously, without being given a name, using either of these syntaxes

```julia
x -> x^2 + 2x - 1
```

and

```julia
function (x)
	x^2 + 2x - 1
end
```

##### So what's the difference?

As previously seen, this creates a function named `f1` with 1-argument locally named `x`

```julia
f1(x) = ...
```


This assigns to the name `f2` a 1-argument function, with an argument locally named `x`

```julia
f2 = x -> undefined
```

###### Examples:

- Directly call an anynoymous functions
```julia
(x -> x + 1)(3) # returns 4
```

- Incredibly useful for disposable functions. Consider `map`, which maps a function onto the elements of a container
```julia
add_1(x) = x + 1
map(add_1, [1,2,3]) == [1+1, 2+1, 3+1]
```

The `add_1` is simply a **partial function application**: take the `+` operator, which adds 2 values, to `+1`, acting just on 1 value
```julia
map(x -> x + 1, [1,2,3]) == [1+1, 2+1, 3+1]

## Types

Types are formats for storing information.

How do we tell if `00011100011000110111011011111010101101` represents a number, or several numbers, or a colour, or a word, or what?

Each computer language has its own way of specifying the formats of information that it can use. Those are its types.



### Supertype `Any` type
Its predefined abstract type that all types are subtypes of:
`Any` is the union of all types, the entire universe of possible types.

# `isa` determines the type of some value
3 isa Any
[1,2,3] isa Any
(x -> 2x) isa Any
f(x) = 3x; f isa Any

**ANY** type we will look at will be a subset of `Any`.

### Anonating types

- You can almost always ignore types
**But why would you?** With minimal effort they bring a lot of information, possibly speed and make your programs safer

- Can annotate the types of our arguments:
```julia
ff(x::Int, y) = x * y

ff(3, 4) # returns 12

ff(3.0, 4) # fails (method not defined!)
```

- Can write a _convertion for the return type_
```julia
function gg(x::Int, y)::Int
    return x * y
end

gg(3, 4) # returns 12

gg(3, 4.1) # errors

**This is very different from annotating the return type**. Because Julia is dynamic it's not possible to guarantee the return type... The maximum one can do is to force a type convertion.

### Multiple dispatch üôè

**Calling the right implementation of a function based on the arguments**. Only the positional arguments and types are used to look up the correct method.

Happening all the time under the hood or on paper: multiplying scalars is completely different from multiplying matrices.

In Julia a function (i.e., the same `name`) may contain multiple concrete implementations (called Methods), selected via multiple dispatch.

- Question: what about functions in OOP languages?

###### Examples of multiple dispatch:
```julia
my_sum(a::Int, b::Int) = a + b
my_sum(a::String, b::String) = a * " " * b # string concatenation is achieved by (*)
```

The dispatch mechanism chooses the most specific method for the input types

```julia
my_sum(2, 3) # returns 5
my_sum("My", "house") # returns a concatenated string
my_sum("Yo", 10) # errors

# Check what exactly is being called with a @which macro
@which my_sum(2,3)

f(x, y::Int) = 1
f(x::Int, y) = 2

In OOP languages, composite types also have named functions methods associated with them, and the combination is called an "object".

**In Julia, all values are objects, but functions are not bundled with the objects they operate on.**

Composite types are introduced with the `struct` keyword followed by a block of field names
```julia
struct MyCar
	brand::String
	color
end
```

Create an object of type `MyCar` by calling a function `MyCar` (which is aumomatically created)

```julia
my_yellow_renault = MyCar("Renault", "yellow")
```

and access its `fields` with the traditional `.`
```julia
my_yellow_renaul.brand # returns "Renault"
```

The functions that create new instances of our composite types are called **constructors**.

Question: Did we use constructors in this class before?

Since **constructors** are just functions, it's straightforward to extend ways of creating `MyCar` objects by adding other methods to the function `MyCar`

- These are called **outer** constructors.

```julia
# All cars are, by-default, black
MyCar(b) = MyCar(b, "black")

my_car1 = MyCar("Mercedes")
my_car2 = MyCar("Mercedes", "white")
```

- One can also add **inner** constructors, which are quite useful for enforcing constraints

```julia
struct MyNewCar
	brand::String
	color
	wheels::Int

	MyNewCar(b, c) = new(b, c, 4)
end
```

Checking the methods available to create an instance of `MyNewCar`
```julia
# We see that we can't really specify the number of wheels
methods(MyNewCar)
```

**Note**: It's good practice to _CamelCase_ composite types and keep normal function names lower-cased. 

The composite types we create until now are **immutable** so we can't really change the fields

```julia
my_car3 = MyNewCar("Mercedes", "blue")
my_car3.color = "yellow" # fails
```

To add **mutability** to the field **values** (not types!), insert the `mutable` keyword
```julia
mutable struct MyMutableCar
	# ...
end
```

- Create an abstract type for the `Animal` kingdom
- Create abstract types for `Reptile`s and `Mammal`s
- Make use of _multiple dispatch_ and write (some) interactions between the animals
```julia
interaction(::Animal, ::Animal) = undefined
interaction(r::Reptile, m::Mammal) = "The reptile attacks the mammal"

- Create **concrete animals**, namely a üêç, a üë® and a üë© (no gender is assumed) and their interactions (extra points if you stick to the historical guidelines)

### Parametric types

Julia's type system is parametric: types can take parameters.

#### Parametric composite types
Type parameters are introduced immediately after the type name, surrounded by curly braces
```julia
struct Point{T}
	x::T
	y::T
end
```
This declaration defines a new parametric composite type, `Point{T}`, holding two "coordinates" of type `T`. What, one may ask, is `T`? Well, that's precisely the point of parametric types: it can be _any_ type at all.

By specifying the parametric type, we obtain an unlimited number of distinct, **usable**, concrete types
```julia
Point{Float64} # point whose coordinates are 64-bit floating-point values
Point{String}  # "point" whose "coordinates" are string objects
```

Note:
- The usual Julia `Array`s are parametric (on their type and dimension)
- Abstract types can also be parametric.

[Read more](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/#Parametric-Types)

#### Type parameters in function signatures
Method definitions can optionally have type parameters qualifying the signature. 
```julia
identity(p::Point{U}) where {U} = p
eltype(p::Point{U}) where {U} = U

fPoint = Point{Float64}(1.0, 2.0)
sPoint = Point{String}("x", "y")

eltype(fPoint) # returns Float64
eltype(sPoint) # returns String
```

Question: Why is the use of a keyword `where` necessary?


##### Pitfals when mixing type hierarchies
```julia
distance(p::Point{Real}) = sqrt(p.x^2 + p.y^2)

distance(fPoint) # fails: no method matching distance(::Point{Float64})
```

Question: If `Float64 <: Real` why does `Point{Float64} <: Point{Real}` yields false? Should there be any hierarchy between `Point{String}`, `Point{Float}` or `Point{Number}`?

The hierarchy wanted was established the level element types of `Point` and not at the level of `Point`s.

Hence,
```julia
distance(p::Point{T}) where {T <: Real} = sqrt(p.x^2 + p.y^2)
```

Think of `Point{T} where T <: Real` as the set of all concrete `Point` types for which element types are a subtype of `Real`: `Point{Float64}, Point{Int64}, Point{Int32}, ...}`

On both tasks disallow behaviour having a function return `error("<error message>")`

- Diagonal dispatch: Create a function `party` that throws a üéâ when both its arguments have the same type

#### Exercise: Write a composite type `Measurement` that can [propagate uncertainties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty)!


Remember that, for some measurement $m_i = \text{val}_i \pm \text{err}_i$, the following rules apply
- $a \,m_i = a \,\text{val}_i \pm a \,\text{err}_i$
- $m_1 + m_2 = (\text{val}_1 + \text{val}_2) \pm \sqrt{\text{err}_1^2 + \text{err}_2^2}$

The latter assumes that variables are **always** uncorrelated, i.e., $\sigma_{12} = 0$, which is not true for, e.g., $m_2 = m_1$. But we are going to assume so because this is just an exercise.

In order to code the algebraic relationships, we need to extend the usual operators.
This is achieved by
```julia
import Base: +
+(a::Number, m::Measurement) = ...
```

Also add a method for `zero`, which is the standard function to zero some type. See how it works on `zero(Float64)` or `zero(Int)`
```julia
import Base: zero
zero(::Type{Measurement}) = ...
```

If you have time, you can also add some syntatic sugar.
There's a [vast set](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/src/julia-parser.scm#L6) of binary infix operators, that is, operators you can insert between operands, such as `a + b` being actually _sugar_ for `+(a,b)`.
Add a function with `¬±` as name to be able to create `Measurements` as `a ¬± b`

## Scoping

The [scope of a variable]((https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/variables-and-scoping/)) is the region of code within which a variable is visible.

Variable scoping helps avoid variable naming conflicts. The concept is intuitive: two functions can both have arguments called `x` without the two `x`'s referring to the same thing.

- Global scope
If a variable is in the global scope (of a module) it is visible even locally

```julia
x = 1
f() = x
f() # will return 1
```

Note: [A module](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/modules/#modules) are workspaces with their own global scope. This is useful because it allows creation of global variables without conflicts! (When you use `REPL` you are in the `Main` module (`@__MODULE__`) so you can define anything you want without having to worry about conflicts with

- Local scope
When you create a function / structure / are inside a loop a local scope is created

```julia
x = 1
function f()
	x = 2
	x
end
f() # will return 2
```

### Blocks

`begin` blocks are great as well but do not introduce a local scope
```julia
y = begin
	c = rand(10)
	3c + 2maximum(c)
end
c # is defined
```

except on, e.g., multi-line function definitions (remember functions introduce local scope!),
```julia
f = x -> begin
	b = rand(10)
	3b + x * maximum(c)
end
```

- Question: Find the rogue global variable

To avoid polluting the global scope (in your notebooks) prefer the `let` blocks
```julia
x = let
	d = rand(10) # temporary variable need for the calculation
	3d + 2maximum(d)
end
d # will throw an error because b is not defined!
```

## Passing by reference: mutating vs. non-mutating functions
Sit down kiddo, let's talk mutability

**Mutable** data can be changed in-place, i.e. literally in the place in memory where the data is stored.

**Immutable** data cannot be changed after creation, and thus the only way to change part of immutable data is to actually make a brand new immutable object from scratch.

For example, `Vector`s are mutable
```julia
v = [5, 5, 5]
v[1] = 6 # change first entry of x
v
```

But e.g. `Tuple`s are immutable
```julia
t = (5, 5, 5)
t[1] = 6
t
```
Note that while a `Tuple` is immutable, its elements may not be!

### Mutable entities in Julia are passed by reference
When passing a mutable container, e.g., an `Array`, this is always passed by reference (i.e., a reference and not a copy of the variable is passed)
```julia
function f(v)
	v[1] = 99
end

x = [1,2,3]
f(x)
x[1] == 99
```
**Pro-tip**: in Julia there's a _convention_ to add a `!` to the name of functions that _mutate_ their arguments: `f!(v) = v[1] = 99`

### Do Julia algebraic operators such as `+=` operate in-place?
Consider the very simple example

```julia
a = 1
b = a
a += 2
b # returns 1
```

The operation does not change the values in `a` but **REBINDS** the name `a` to the result of `a + 2a`, which of course is a new array.

Any operation such as `a+=2a` is just _syntatic sugar_ for
```julia
temp = a + 2a
a = temp
```

###### In Julia **ALL** updating operators are not in-place
(there are ways around this, but more on that later)

Note: if you are coming from Python you may have an unhealthy relationship with `+=`-like operators: they behave like the above example, but with `Numpy` they act in-place (i.e., mutate the arrays).

In Julia, with an array, the behaviour is just like as the example with a scalar,

```julia
a = [1,2]
b = a

a += 2a
b
```
